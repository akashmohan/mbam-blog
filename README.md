repository containing everything about my blog.

## about mbam
mbam or made by akashmohan is everything i have got to share to the world about code. the posts in this blog could be articles, screencasts or even series of podcasts which may contain my thoughts and opinions about code, how to build stuff, how to tutorials etc.

## about the design side of this project
i have taken a very simple and minimal approch while building the design for this project. i have decided to stick with the two basic colors, shades of black and white. the minimal approch will also be reflected in the animations.  and as usual mbam-blog is built by adapting to the mobile first perspective.
